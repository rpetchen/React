To install all dependencies run 'npm install' from the command line. 

Once all dependencies have been installed the user can start the react application by running 'npm Start'

The application is a book shelf manager allowing a user to track and record which books they're currently reading, have read, or want to read. Additionally, the user can access a back end API to search for additional books they're interested in and add those books to one of their three shelves. The back end API persists the users selection and shelves, allowing the user to continually manage the state of their book shelves.
